#  Create a Database file for a bookstore that contains:
#           id (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)
#           booktitle   (TEXT)
#           isbn        (TEXT)
#           genre       (TEXT)
#           instock     (BOOLEAN)

# name the file 'myBooks_YOUR_INITIALS.db'

# you will create a CSV file named 'inventory_YOUR_INITIALS.csv'
# it will contain the above information for 10 books of your choice


# you will create a python program that will read that CSV file and populate your database. Name the file
# dbReader_YOUR_INITIALS.py  (dbReader_CS.py)

# HAND IN all three files. - Comment your name into your code in the python file.
# 
# Good luck. :)
